The importance of specific features in TSVT depends on your organization's priorities, use cases, and Tableau Server deployment requirements. However, here are five aspects that are generally considered important:

Customized Validation Logic:
        The ability to define and implement custom validation logic is crucial. It allows you to tailor the tool to match your organization's unique            Tableau Server configurations, ensuring that critical aspects are validated according to specific requirements.

Domain-Specific Checks:
        Domain-specific checks are important for organizations with unique business processes or compliance requirements. TSVT's capability to include          validations specific to your industry or domain ensures that the tool aligns with your organization's needs.

Automated Testing Workflows:
        Automated testing workflows contribute to efficiency and reliability. TSVT should support automated testing, making it easier to validate               Tableau Server configurations consistently. This is especially important for organizations that regularly update or modify their Tableau Server         environment.

Reporting and Notifications:
        Detailed reporting and notification features are crucial for staying informed about the health of your Tableau Server deployment. TSVT should           provide clear alerts or reports when validation checks fail, allowing for proactive identification and resolution of issues.

Extensibility and Modularity:
        Extensibility and modularity ensure that TSVT remains adaptable to changing requirements. The ability to easily add new checks or validations           as your organization evolves is valuable for long-term usability and maintenance.
